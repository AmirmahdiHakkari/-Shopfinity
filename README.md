* Internationalization (i18next): Persian (fa), English (en), French (fr).
* Fully responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
* Forms handled with React Hook Form.
* Fetching product data via Axios (example: `https://dummyjson.com/products`).
* Head management with `react-helmet-async` for SEO-friendly titles.

## üöÄ Local setup (Development)

**Prerequisites**:

* Node.js (recommended >=16)
* npm 

**Steps**:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd Shopfinity
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Environment variables

Create a `.env` file if needed and add sample variables:

```
VITE_API_BASE=https://dummyjson.com
# or your real API base URL
```

4. Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## üîß Useful scripts (example)

Typical `package.json` scripts in this project:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx"
  }
}
```

(If your `package.json` differs, the real scripts will be used.)

## üåê Internationalization (i18n)

* All user-facing texts are managed by `react-i18next` with translation files located in `src/i18n/`.
* Suggested file layout:

  * `src/i18n/en.json` (English)
  * `src/i18n/fa.json` (Persian)
  * `src/i18n/fr.json` (French)
* To add a new language: create a translation JSON and register it in the i18n configuration.
* Make sure to set the document `dir` (LTR/RTL) depending on the current language (e.g., `dir="rtl"` for Persian).

## üîÅ State management & cart

* The shopping cart is stored in Redux (for example `redux/cartSlice.ts`).
* Actions manage add/remove/update quantity behavior.
* Total price is computed on the Checkout page from the cart items.

## üì° API integration

* Axios is used to fetch products and other data. Example used in the products page: `https://dummyjson.com/products`.
* For a real backend provide endpoints for: Products, Product by ID, Auth, Orders.
* If authentication is required, include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

## üß© Important components & pages

* `components/`:

  * `product-Item`, `FilterNav`, `Basket-Sidebar`, `CheckoutForm`, `LoginForm`, `ForgotPassForm`, dashboard widgets, and chart components.
* `pages/public/`:

  * Landing, Products, Basket, Checkout, Contact, About, Login, ForgotPassword, NotFound
* `pages/dashboard/`:

  * Overview, DashboardProducts, DashboardCreateProduct, DashboardEditProduct

## ‚úÖ Developer tips

* Use modern image formats (WebP) and lazy-loading for better performance.
* Break large components into smaller pieces to improve testability and maintainability.
* Use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` when appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
* When supporting RTL languages, ensure the root element `dir` changes and UI components respond correctly.

## ‚úÖ README checklist (optional enhancements)

* [ ] Add screenshots (upload images to the repo) to showcase key pages
* [ ] Insert the real `package.json` content for accurate dependencies & scripts
* [ ] Document API endpoints (routes and request/response examples)
* [ ] Add CI/CD hints (GitHub Actions or Vercel config) if desired
